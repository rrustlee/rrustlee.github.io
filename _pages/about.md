I'm a first year phd student from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research interest includes Large Languge Model, machine learning, and computational photography.
I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Sun](https://xusun26.github.io/) of Lanco Lab from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University. I was advised by [Prof. XX](https://XXX.pku.edu.cn/) from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University.
